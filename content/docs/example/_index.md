# Introduction


## About this gig

I will deliver fully-fledged RPG bot with many standard RPG game systems i.e.
battle, pet, armor, talent and many more you can think of. If you think your bot
need a mini-game I can make it too. Just share your idea and I will make it
exactly how you wanted.


Following are the list of systems that I've developed before:

- in-game currency
- battle
- leader board
- pet
- armor
- talent/skill
- mini games


If you think your needed system is not in the list, let me know as we can
discuss how your awesome system looks like. The game implementations and
mechanics can be customized.


I also accept using NFT as a character in the RPG bot.

## RPG Systems

All of the rpg systems are highly tested and balance for a discord bot game.
Players of the developed RPG bot should not feel too hard when they just
starting out and also does not kill the fun from the game when they are reaching
high level.

## Experience

I've developed a successful RPG bot **(ChaosRPG)** before. So I know what people
wants in a RPG bot.
