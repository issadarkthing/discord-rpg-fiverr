# Pet and Skill
Pet and skill help player fight in battle. Both will intercept randomly based on
intercept rate % during battle. Higher intercept rate will cause pet or skill
appear during battle more frequent. Both of these need to be activated using
`!inventory` command.

Custom images can be added to both pet and skill and it will also show up during
battle to make the battle more exciting.
