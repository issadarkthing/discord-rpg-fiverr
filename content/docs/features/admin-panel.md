# Admin Panel

Admin panel allows you to modify players data real time. Bot owners will have
greater administration of their own bot. You can simply edit players
coin, level, xp, current monster, win and hunt count, players inventory can
also be changed.

However, the implementation of the admin panel and updates are up to the
developer as you do not own the admin panel website. Despite that, suggestion
and feedback are welcomed.
